        comment: `I love Brad’s courses. Learned a lot from him. But in this course, last MERN project had me lost. Brad uses Redux Toolkit to handle most of the functions. If you are like me and didn’t use Redux toolkit going through the content becomes a torture.`

        comment: `Overall good course but more explanation could have helped the learner understand things better. Instead of 4 projects, 3 projects were enough to cover all concepts, and remaining time could have been used for details explanation.`
