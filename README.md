Published to Netlify to show a working example of this CRUD application.
To view the working app:

Based off of "Feedback App" by Brad Traversy:
https://github.com/bradtraversy/feedback-app

Technologies used:

- React to build the frontend.
- Mock REST API JSON server running on Heroku (https://github.com/jesperorb/json-server-heroku) to handle backend HTTP requests since Netlify doesn't support them.
- Node.js for runtime environment.
- Git for version control.

- VS Code for code editor.
